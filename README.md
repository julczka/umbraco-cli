# umbraco-cli

A cli helper for extending the Umbraco backoffice.
For now it doesn't do much.

## Usage

To use this CLI run the following command:

```sh
npx umb-cli
```

Or install it globally on your machine:

```sh
npm i -g umb-cli
```

and then type this command into your terminal:

```sh
umbraco
```
